👋🏾 Hi, I'm France! (Like the country)

👩🏾‍💻 I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer transitioning from over 10 years of experience in healthcare. My journey has allowed me to develop strong problem-solving, process optimization, and data-driven decision-making skills, which I now apply to tech projects.

👩🏾‍⚕️ Currently, I’m building my expertise in web and mobile development, and I’m passionate about leveraging both my healthcare background and tech skills to create impactful, user-centered solutions.

🛠️ Technologies I work with:

Frontend: HTML, CSS

Currently learning: JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

🌍 Fun Fact: I visited 4 countries in just 10 days—across two continents!
